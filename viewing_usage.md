# Viewing your usage
{: #viewingusage}

As an account owner, or a billing manager for an org, you can use the Usage Dashboard page in the {{site.data.keyword.Bluemix}} console to see a summary of estimated charges for all resources that are used per month in your organizations. 

To open the Usage Dashboard page, click **Manage** > **Billing and Usage** > **Usage**. You can see a summary of the resource usage for the account. Billing managers can see the details for only the organizations in which they are billing managers.

   * Click **View instances** to see a summary of estimated charges for all instances of a specific resource. 
   * Click **View instance** to see a detailed summary of estimated charges for each instance of the specific resource type. You can also see the detailed monthly usage metrics for the selected instance. 

The account owner is charged for the total usage that is incurred across all organizations at the end of each billing cycle. Each billing cycle lasts one month.

Account owners can filter the usage summary by organization. If you are an account owner, set **Group** to **Account** to see the usage for the entire account for a 12-month period. Select a particular month to see the usage for that month.  The charges shown represent the amount that you, as the account owner, are billed for that month.

If you select a specific organization from the **Group** list, you can see the total usage for that organization, including any usage as part of a free tier. The charges shown for the organization are not the charges that you are billed. The free tier usage is shown as free at the account level, but not at the organizational level. Therefore, when you view the organizational usage, you see the real usage for that organization including both free and charged usage. All organizational usage is rolled up to the account usage after the free tier is removed.

As an account manager of a Pay-As-You-Go account, you can set spending notifications against the total cost of your account, for your runtime, services, and for individual services, excluding third-party services. You receive notifications when you reach 80%, 90%, and 100% of the spending thresholds that you specify. For more information, see [Setting notifications](/docs/account/notifications.html).

## Viewing credits
{: #credits}
