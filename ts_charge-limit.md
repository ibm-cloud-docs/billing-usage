# Why am I getting a charge limit error when I try to make a payment?
{: #ts-charge-limit}
{: troubleshoot}

You can't make a full payment on your invoice because of a charge limit.
{: shortdesc}

You try to make a payment on an invoice that is over $1,000.00 USD, but you get the following error message:
{: tsSymptoms}

> Manual payment request cannot be processed. Payment amount is higher than the limit allowed.

By default, credit card payments in US Dollars cannot exceed $1,000.00 USD, which might cause you to make multiple payments to pay your invoice.
{: tsCauses}

You can contact [{{site.data.keyword.Bluemix_notm}} Support](/unifiedsupport/supportcenter){: external} to request an increase in this maximum credit card payment limit. All requests are considered based on the payment and invoice history of the account.
