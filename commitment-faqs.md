# FAQs for Enterprise Savings Plan
{: #commitmentfaqs}

## What is the difference between Enterprise Savings Plan and a Subscription account?
{: #commitment-subscription}
{: faq}

The Enterprise Savings Plan model is similar to the Subscription model. Unlike a subscription, when you have a commitment, you commit to spend a certain amount and receive discounts across the platform even after your commitment term ends. Any overage that is incurred on the account continues to receive a discount.

## Can I convert my US-based USD Pay-As-You-Go to a Subscription account? If so, what kind of impact does the commitment model have?
{: #paygo-to-subscription}
{: faq}

Yes, you can convert your account from US-based USD Pay-As-You-Go to an Enterprise Savings Plan, but it will be only effective after the term end of your former plan.

## Why can't I add a child account with an active commitment to an enterprise?
{: #child-commitment}
{: faq}

Accounts with active commitments can't be imported to the enterprise until their commitment term ends. You will see the following message:

*Unable to import account*
*[Account name] can't be imported until the end of the commitment term.*

Child accounts must complete any active commitment term before they are added to an enterprise.
