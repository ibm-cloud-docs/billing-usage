# Moving to {{site.data.keyword.IBM_notm}} Partner Programs
{: #migrate-to-partner}

Any SoftLayer Partner that signed the following agreements before May 2021 is required to sign an {{site.data.keyword.IBM}} Partner Agreement and create a new {{site.data.keyword.IBM_notm}} order by 31 October 2024:
- SoftLayer Reseller Agreement
- Federal Resell Program Addendum
- SoftLayer Solution & Service Provider Attachment (SSSPA) to the CSA
- IBM Cloud Enterprise Service Agreement (ESA) Click & Accept

Moving to IBM Partner Programs requires a new IBM Resell or ESA order. All IBM Business Partners are required to join [IBM Partner Plus](https://www.ibm.com/partnerplus/){: external}. Moving your SoftLayer account or accounts to {{site.data.keyword.IBM_notm}} requires ordering a new commitment with [{{site.data.keyword.cloud_notm}} Sales](https://www.ibm.com/cloud?contactmodule){: external}, but your resources and account structure remain unchanged.

Direct accounts must pay all invoices in full before you can move to {{site.data.keyword.IBM_notm}} Partner Programs. To pay your invoice in the {{site.data.keyword.cloud_notm}} console, go to **Manage** > **Billing and usage**, and select **Payments**. Review the following sections to understand the changes that apply to partners.

## Before you begin
{: #before-bp-migration}

- All usage will be billed one month in arrears. For example, all classic and platform usage that you consume in the month of June is invoiced in July. A single, consolidated invoice for one month of usage is issued on the 8th of the following month.
- During the transition to this new billing cycle, you might see prorated charges for services that were billed on different schedules. For example, you might have monthly infrastructure services that are billed in advance, hourly usage products that are billed one month in arrears, or platform resources that are billed two months in arrears. The new billing cycle aligns all services to a one-month in arrears model.
- The company name that is displayed on your credit card statement is changing.
- All usage information will be available on the [billing and usage dashboard](/billing/) in the {{site.data.keyword.cloud}} console. Your old experience doesn't include a consilidated view of your platform and classic infrastructure usage.

For more information, review the updates to the [invoicing schedule and format](/docs/billing-usage?topic=billing-usage-migrate-to-simple#invoice-compare), how to view your [detailed billing](/docs/billing-usage?topic=billing-usage-migrate-to-simple#find-detials), and where to find your new [invoices](/docs/billing-usage?topic=billing-usage-migrate-to-simple#new-invoices).
