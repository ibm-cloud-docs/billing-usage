## Using {{site.data.keyword.Bluemix_notm}} services with SoftLayer assets
{: #combined}

You can easily use API-based public {{site.data.keyword.Bluemix_notm}} services with your SoftLayer assets. All APIs are secure and encrypted so that your data is protected.

For example, have you ever wanted to add cognitive capabilities from Watson to your apps running on bare metal servers from SoftLayer? You can add a service such as {{site.data.keyword.personalityinsightsshort}} to help understand your app's user in four steps:

1. Find the service in the catalog.
2. Provision an instance of the service with just a few clicks.
3. Set up the service to run with your existing code by copying the service credentials and adding them to your application.
4. After the update to the app, deploy the new version on your SoftLayer infrastructure.

You can gain Insights and Cognitive knowledge by calling Watson APIs from your apps in SoftLayer to make them more personalized. Or, use Data and Analytics services to tap into high performance analytics for your apps. Or, choose database-as-a-service where you can leave the management to {{site.data.keyword.Bluemix_notm}}.

Modernize your application development by using containers with services like {{site.data.keyword.activedeployshort}} and {{site.data.keyword.deliverypipeline}}. You can then use the {{site.data.keyword.vpn_short}} service to communicate with SoftLayer to connect your container in a private network to the SoftLayer private network. All of the usage charges of the compute resources and services are reflected in your {{site.data.keyword.Bluemix_notm}} bill.
