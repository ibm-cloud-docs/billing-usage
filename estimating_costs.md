# Estimating your costs
{: #cost}

You can use the cost estimator to estimate the cost of {{site.data.keyword.Bluemix}} products by customizing plans that fit your business needs. Your account type doesn't affect your estimates. Explore the catalog to find available products to add to an estimate.

Estimates can now be saved to an account. Make sure you're in the account that you want to save the estimate to. If you have existing estimates, they must be converted to a saved estimate that is attached to an account.
