# Enterprise Savings Plan billing model
{: #committed-use}

The {{site.data.keyword.cloud}} Enterprise Savings Plan billing model is similar to the billing model for Subscription accounts but with a few added benefits. With this billing model, you commit to spend a certain amount on {{site.data.keyword.cloud_notm}} and receive discounts across the platform. You are billed monthly based on your usage and you continue to receive a discount even after you reach your committed amount.

## Signing up for a commitment
{: #sign-up-commit}

To use the {{site.data.keyword.cloud_notm}} Enterprise Savings Plan billing model, you must have a Subscription account. After you have the correct account, work with [{{site.data.keyword.Bluemix_notm}} Sales](https://www.ibm.com/cloud?contactmodule){: external} to sign up for this billing model. The sales team creates a commitment quote based on the spending amount for the period that you want to commit to.

After you accept the commitment quote, you receive an additional email to confirm that your payment information is processed and that the commitment is added to your account.

## Viewing your commitment quote
{: #committed-view}

After you contact [{{site.data.keyword.Bluemix_notm}} Sales](https://www.ibm.com/cloud?contactmodule){: external} and sign up for a commitment, you receive a quote. The commitment quote details your contract period, duration of the commitment, billing frequency, UOM, discount, and commitment terms. The sales team emails you a copy of your quote.

## Viewing your commitment usage
{: #committed-usage}

The Enterprise Savings Plan page provides the usage details for your commitment on the account. You can track your usage month to month for a detailed view of your commitment usage history. To access this information, you need an access policy with the viewer role or higher on the billing account management service. See [IAM access](/docs/account?topic=account-userroles) for more information.

To view your Enterprise Savings Plan usage in the {{site.data.keyword.cloud}} console, go to **Manage > Billing and usage > Commitments** and select **Enterprise Savings Plan**.

* Click the tabs to view information about active or upcoming commitments. Active commitments are commitments that still have a remaining committed amount to spend and time that's remaining in the commitment term. Upcoming commitments are commitments that were added to the account but haven't yet reached their term period. A commitment is inactive if its term expires or all of its committed amount is spent.
* Use the graph to view what you've spent toward your overall committed amount. You can view the days remaining in the commitment, discount, billing method, and billing frequency.
* View a monthly breakdown of the spending history for the commitment. Monthly spending is broken out by month. You can manage your commitment by viewing any change in spending month to month as well as viewing your spending trends over time.

## Remaining commitment
{: #unmet-commit}

If you don't spend the total committed amount by the end of the commitment term, you are invoiced for the amount that you didn't consume. The graph on the Enterprise Savings Plan page provides details about what you've spent toward your overall committed amount, so you can easily track what you've consumed and how much time is remaining in your commitment.

## Product-level discounts
{: #product-discount-esp}

In addition to the platform-level discount applied to an Enterprise Savings Plan commitment, you can receive additional discounts that apply to a service, category, plan, and metric. Discounts on products vary depending on your account type.

The discount that you receive on platform usage does not combine with a product-level discount that you might receive for a service, category, plan, and metric.
{: note}

To view the discounts that are applied to your commitment in the {{site.data.keyword.Bluemix_notm}} console, go to **Manage** > **Billing and usage** > **Commitments** > **Enterprise Savings Plan**. In the discounts section, use the table to view your active discounts.

For more information about product-level discounts through your Enterprise Savings Plan, work with [{{site.data.keyword.Bluemix_notm}} Sales](https://www.ibm.com/cloud?contactmodule){: external}.


## Getting support
{: #committed-use-support}

Both support plans cost just 10% of your annual commitment and usage. To get support, contact [{{site.data.keyword.Bluemix_notm}} Sales](https://www.ibm.com/cloud?contactmodule){: external}.
