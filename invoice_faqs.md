# FAQs for invoices
{: #invoice-faq}

Review the following FAQs to find helpful information about invoices. To find all FAQs for {{site.data.keyword.cloud}}, see our [FAQ library](/docs/faqs).
{: shortdesc}

## Where can I access my invoice?
{: #access-invoices}
{: faq}
{: support}

If you have a billable account, you can access your invoice by clicking **Manage > Billing and usage**, and selecting **Invoices**. If you have a Lite account, you don't have an invoice because you're never charged for Lite plan usage.

You might be redirected to view your invoices on the [IBM Invoices website](https://www.ibm.com/support/customer/invoices/){: external}. See [How do I view invoices for Pay-As-You-Go or Subscription accounts?](/docs/billing-usage?topic=billing-usage-ts_cant-view-invoice) and [Viewing your invoices](/docs/billing-usage?topic=billing-usage-managing-invoices) for more information.

## Why does my usage not match my invoice?
{: #usage-not-match-invoice}
{: faq}
{: support}

Your usage might not match your invoice because the months that are used to compare usage aren't the same, or the total amount of the orgs wasn't selected. For more information, see [Viewing your usage](/docs/billing-usage?topic=billing-usage-viewingusage). If it still doesn't match, get in touch with us by calling 1-866-325-0045 and choosing the third option, or by opening a [support case](/unifiedsupport/supportcenter){: external}.

## Why can't I manage my invoices?
{: #slperm-manage-invoices}
{: faq}

You might not have the correct permissions. Ask your account owner to add you to the View account summary access group. For more information, see [Managing migrated SoftLayer account permissions](/docs/account?topic=account-migrated_permissions).

## How can I download my invoice?
{: #invoice-spreadsheet}
{: faq}

To download your invoice, go to **Manage > Billing and usage**, and select **Invoices**. Then, click the **Download** icon ![Download icon](../icons/download.svg "Download") and choose an invoice format. You can download an invoice as a simplified PDF, a detailed PDF, or as an excel spreadsheet.

In some cases, you are redirected to the [IBM Invoices website](https://www.ibm.com/support/customer/invoices/){: external} where you can download your invoices. From the Invoices page, click the **Actions** icon ![Actions icon](../icons/action-menu-icon.svg "Actions") and select the invoice format.

## Is paperless invoicing available?
{: #paperless-invoices}

## What are the adjustments that are shown on my invoice?
{: #adjustments-invoices}
{: faq}

The adjustments section of your current invoice includes charges or credits from previous billing periods that weren't included on your previous invoice.

## How do I know if my invoice is paid?
{: #paid-invoices}
{: faq}

If you manage your invoices through the {{site.data.keyword.IBM_notm}} Console, you can see their status by clicking **Manage > Billing and usage**, and selecting **Invoices**. When the invoice is paid, the status says Closed. If your invoices are managed through the [IBM Invoices website](https://www.ibm.com/support/customer/invoices/){: external}, it's paid when the status says Settled.

## Can my usage differ from what's reflected on my invoice?
{: #invoice-usage-differ}
{: #faq}

Yes. An {{site.data.keyword.Bluemix_notm}} service might provide a free allocation before the start of your billing period. To determine whether your service instance provides a free allocation, go to the [Resources list](/resources) in the {{site.data.keyword.cloud_notm}} console. Click the service name, and then click **Plan**. Free allocations are applied to the account level and not the organization level.

In addition, depending on your account type, your usage is incurred and reflected differently on your invoice. For more information, see [Invoicing for different account types](/docs/billing-usage?topic=billing-usage-understand-invoices#different-acct-invoice).
