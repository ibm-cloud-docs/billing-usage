# FAQs for invoices
{: #invoice-faq}
{: faq}

Review the following FAQs to find helpful information about invoices. To find all FAQs for {{site.data.keyword.cloud}}, see our [FAQ library](https://{DomainName}/docs/faqs).

## Where can I access my invoice?
{: #access-invoices}
{: faq}
{: support}

If you have a billable account, you can access your invoice by clicking **Manage > Billing and usage**, and selecting **Invoices**. If you have a Lite account, you don't have an invoice because you're never charged for Lite plan usage.

For Pay-As-You-Go accounts that aren't billed in US dollars or Subscription accounts, you can also view your invoices on the [IBM Invoices website](https://www.ibm.com/invoices){: external}. See [How do I view invoices for Pay-As-You-Go or Subscription accounts?](/docs/billing-usage?topic=billing-usage-ts_cant-view-invoice).

## Why does my usage not match my invoice?
{: #usage-not-match-invoice}
{: faq}
{: support}

Your usage might not match your invoice because the months that are used to compare usage aren't the same, or the total amount of the orgs wasn't selected. For more information, see [Viewing your usage](/docs/billing-usage?topic=billing-usage-viewingusage). If it still doesn't match, get in touch with us by calling 1-866-325-0045 and choosing the third option, or by opening a [support case](https://{DomainName}/unifiedsupport/supportcenter){: external}.

## Why can't I manage my invoices?
{: #slperm-manage-invoices}
{: faq}

The SoftLayer permission for managing invoices might not have been migrated correctly in {{site.data.keyword.Bluemix_notm}}. Ask your account owner to add you to the View account summary access group. For more information, see [Managing migrated SoftLayer account permissions](/docs/iam?topic=iam-migrated_permissions).

## How do I request paperless invoicing? 
{: #paperless-invoices}
{: faq}

Yes, you can switch to paperless invoices by submitting a request on the [IBM Customer Support site](https://www.ibm.com/support/customer/zz/en/selectcountrylang.html). For more information, see [Requesting paperless invoices](/docs/billing-usage?topic=billing-usage-managing-invoices#request-paperless-invoices).
