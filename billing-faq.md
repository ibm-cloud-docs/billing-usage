## How do I update my credit card?
{: #updatecard}
{: faq}

You can update the payment method that's associated with your account by going to [Payments](https://{DomainName}/billing/payments) in the console. Under Add Payment Method, enter in the billing information for your new card, then click **Add credit card**.

To switch to a different payment method, select **Pay with Other** and then click **Submit change request**. A support case to change your payment method will be created for you.

Contact us by calling 1-866-325-0045 and selecting the third option.


## Are feature codes the same as promo codes?
{: #entercode}
{: faq}

Promo codes and feature codes are different!

- Promo codes are infrastructure-specific promotional codes that you might receive from the Sales team. You enter them in the customer portal at check-out to get a discount on your order.
- Feature codes are used to add subscription and support credit to your account. For Lite accounts, they are also used to offer extra resources or capabilities, such as for educational events.

   If you purchase a subscription, you typically receive an email with the feature code. To redeem your feature code, go to **Manage > Account**, and select **Account settings**. Under Feature Codes, click **Apply code**. If you don't see this option in your account, you might not have the required access roles. For more information, see [Applying feature codes](/docs/account?topic=account-codes).

## What is a GB-hour?
{: #gb-hour}
{: faq}

Runtime and container usage is charged based on the following variables:
 • How much memory your runtime or container uses, in gigabytes (GB)
 • The duration that memory is used

Multiply the two values together, and the result is the GB-hour.

## How many apps can I build?
{: #howmanyapps}
{: faq}

In a Lite account, your apps have up to 256 MB of instantaneous runtime memory. You can deploy apps until you use the available Lite account allowance. If you need more memory, upgrade to a billable account to get 512 MB of free instantaneous runtime memory and pay only for what you use over that. There's no limits to the number of apps you can build in a billable account.


## What happens if my Lite plan instance reaches the monthly quota?
{: #monthlyquota}
