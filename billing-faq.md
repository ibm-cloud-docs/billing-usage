# FAQs for billing and usage
{: #billusagefaqs}

FAQs for billing and usage might include questions about credit cards, promo codes, or other billing-related issues. To find all FAQs for {{site.data.keyword.cloud}}, see our [FAQ library](/docs/faqs).
{: shortdesc}

## What is a GB-hour?
{: #gb-hour}
{: faq}

Runtime and container usage is charged based on the following variables:

* How much memory your runtime or container uses, in gigabytes (GB).
* The duration that memory is used.

Multiply the two values together, and the result is the GB-hour.

## How are bandwidth overage charges calculated for Bare Metal Servers and Virtual Servers?
{: #bandwidth-usage}
{: faq}

{{site.data.keyword.cloud_notm}} systems monitor all inbound and outbound traffic for a server regardless of the type of traffic. Based on the allocated bandwidth for a server, overages are assessed for excess traffic, which is monitored at the network switch level. Monitor your bandwidth usage with bandwidth graphs. For more information, see [Viewing bandwidth graphs](/docs/bare-metal?topic=bare-metal-bm-view-bandwidth-graphs).


## How do I prevent bandwidth overages?
{: #bandwidth-usage-overages}
{: faq}

If you provision multiple servers, you can potentially reduce future bandwidth overage charges by pooling your servers' bandwidth. For more information, see [Optimizing your bandwidth usage](/docs/bare-metal?topic=bare-metal-bm-view-bandwidth-graphs#bm-optimize-bandwidth-usage). Contact an [{{site.data.keyword.cloud_notm}} Sales](https://www.ibm.com/cloud?contactmodule){: external} representative to request a quote for more server bandwidth.

##  What's the difference between a Pay-As-You-Go and a Subscription account?
{: #billable-account-types}
{: faq}

With Pay-As-You-Go accounts, you're billed monthly for your resource usage. Your resource usage consists of recurring and fluctuating costs. This account type is a good fit for developers or companies that want to explore the entire {{site.data.keyword.cloud_notm}} catalog but have low-volume or variable workloads. You pay only for what you use or commit to on a monthly basis, with no long-term contracts. Usage consists of products, services, and resources.

With Subscription accounts, you buy a subscription for an amount of credit to spend on resource usage within a certain time period. In exchange for this spending commitment, you get a discount on your usage costs. For more information about the differences between account types, see [Account types](/docs/account?topic=account-accounts).

## What happens if my Lite plan instance reaches the monthly quota?
{: #monthlyquota}
{: faq}
{: support}

When you reach any quota for Lite plan instances, the service for that month is suspended. Quotas are based per org and not per instance. New instances that are created in the same org show any usage from previous instances. The quota resets on the first of every month.

## Can I use PayPal as a payment method?
{: #paypal}
{: faq}
{: support}

## Can I update my credit card?
{: #updatecard}

## How do I change my payment method?
{: #pay-method}

## How do I pay an invoice?
{: #pay-invoice}

## Can I delete my credit card?
{: #removecard}
{: faq}

For Pay-As-you-Go accounts, you must have an active credit card on file. You can replace an existing credit card with a new one.

## What's the difference between promo codes and feature codes?
{: #promo-feature-codes}
{: faq}

Promo codes are for Pay-As-You-Go and Subscription accounts and give you limited-time credits toward your account and {{site.data.keyword.Bluemix_notm}} products. The codes are typically short phrases, like `PROMO200`. For more information about promo codes, see [Managing promotions](/docs/billing-usage?topic=billing-usage-applying-promo-codes).

Feature codes provide enhancements for an account, such as an unlimited number of organizations or creating a trial account. Feature codes are typically provided for online courses and certain events, such as educational sessions or conference workshops. They're typically random alphanumeric codes, like `a1b2c3def456`. For more information about feature codes, see [Applying feature codes](/docs/account?topic=account-codes).

## Where can I get a promo code?
{: #get-promo-code}
{: faq}

Promo codes are provided on a limited basis by {{site.data.keyword.Bluemix_notm}} sales to customers with Pay-As-You-Go and Subscription accounts. Promotions provide specific discounts for a set amount of time. For more information, see [Applying promo codes](/docs/billing-usage?topic=billing-usage-applying-promo-codes).

## Where can I get a feature code?
{: #get-feature-code}
{: faq}

Feature codes are provided by {{site.data.keyword.Bluemix_notm}} sales and educational providers on a limited basis. Feature codes are meant for select groups and are typically given out at hackathons, conferences, and other events. If you are taking a course through an educational provider and need more resources to complete the course, contact your educational provider to determine whether a feature code is applicable.

## How do I apply a promo code?
{: #how-apply-promo}
{: faq}

If you can't apply a promo code that you received from {{site.data.keyword.Bluemix_notm}} Sales or an educational provider, contact sales or the provider for more help.
{: note}

## Why did I get invoiced when I have remaining promotion credits?
{: #billed-promo}
{: faq}

If you think your invoice didn't include your promotion credits, first determine that the credits are still active on your account by using the following steps:

1. In the {{site.data.keyword.Bluemix_notm}} console, go to **Manage** > **Billing and usage**, and select **Promotions and credits**.
1. Click a promotion to expand the table and view the amount of each promotion, the duration of each promotion and the product it applies to.
1. Check the following to make sure that your promo code is still applicable:
   - Verify the maximum value of the promo code per month. Some monthly recurring promo codes have a monthly limit. If your usage exceeded that limit, you're billed for the remaining amount.
   - Compare the date of your invoice to the start and end dates of the promo code. If you applied the promo code after the invoice was issued, it was not applied to that month's invoice.
   - If you didn't use the products that are impacted by the promo code before it expired, you don't receive the promotion credits.

After you complete these steps, if you still believe that the invoice amount is an error, create a support case. Go to the [Support Center](/unifiedsupport/supportcenter) and click **Create a case**.


## How do I apply a feature code?
{: #entercode}
{: faq}
{: support}

Feature codes add more capabilities in an account and are typically provided for educational initiatives or special events. To redeem your code, go to the [Account settings](/account/settings) page in the console, and click **Apply code**. You can also apply your code to a new account by clicking **Register with a code** when you [sign up for a new account](/registration).

You might be looking for information about promo codes and subscription codes, which are available for certain account types. For more information, see [Managing promotions](/docs/billing-usage?topic=billing-usage-applying-promo-codes) and [Applying subscription codes](/docs/billing-usage?topic=billing-usage-subscription_code).


## Why did my account get billed for additional services charges?
{: #getting-billed}
{: faq}

As the account owner, you're responsible for all charges that are incurred by users in your account, including invited users. Ensure that each user is assigned only the level of access that is required to complete their job, including the ability to create new instances that might incur additional charges in your account. For more information, see [Managing access to resources](/docs/account?topic=account-assign-access-resources).

Resources and applications that remain running in an account are subject to charges based on the pricing and description of the product. For example, this includes buildpacks, Platform as a Service, and Infrastructure as a Service.

If you believe that charges on your invoice are incorrect, [contact Support](/unifiedsupport/supportcenter){: external} within 30 calendar days of the invoice due date or use the contact information that is found on your invoice.

## Why did I get billed for a resource I deleted?
{: #stop-billing}
{: faq}

A [resource](#x2004267){: term} is anything that you can create from the catalog that is managed by and contained within a resource group. You're billed for resources in your account until you cancel them. If you deleted a resource or have resources in your account that are no longer used, make sure to cancel all billing items associated with those resources. Billing items can't be recovered after they are canceled. For more information, see [Cancelling your billing items](/docs/billing-usage?topic=billing-usage-cancel-billing-items).


## Can I add a tax identification number to my account?
{: #tax-assessment}
{: faq}

{: #monitor-spending}
{: faq}

## Can I receive notifications when my spending reaches specific levels?
{: #spending-notification}
{: faq}
{: support}

You can set separate spending thresholds for the account, container, runtime, all services, and specific services. You automatically receive notifications when your monthly spending reaches 80%, 90%, and 100% of those thresholds. To set spending notifications, click **Manage > Billing and usage** and select **Spending notifications**. For more information, see [Setting spending notifications](/docs/billing-usage?topic=billing-usage-spending).

These options include the use of time-based one-time passcode authentication, security questions, third-party authentication mechanisms, and password expiration rules. For more information, see [Types of multifactor authentication](/docs/account?topic=account-types).

You can regularly review the list of account users and remove users who don't need access to the account. For more information, see [Removing users from an account](/docs/account?topic=account-remove).
