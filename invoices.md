# Viewing your invoices 
{: #managing-invoices}

To manage and view your invoices, visit the [Invoices](https://cloud.ibm.com/billing/invoices){: external} page from the billing and usage dashboard in the {{site.data.keyword.cloud}} console. If your account is billed through a separate billing platform, you can see the following message on the Invoices page:

`The account is invoiced on a separate billing platform. This page reflects only classic infrastructure charges. To view your official invoice and for any pricing inquiries, visit IBM Invoices.`

In these situations, visit the [Invoices@IBM](http://ibm.com/invoices){: external} website to see your invoices.

## Before you begin
{: #setting-prereqs}

To view your invoices, you need to be assigned the operator role or higher on the billing account management service. For more information, see [Assigning access to account management services](/docs/account?topic=account-account-services).

## Viewing invoices for new US-based Pay-As-You-Go accounts with credit card billing
{: #viewing-invoices-tob}

New {{site.data.keyword.cloud_notm}} Pay-As-You-Go accounts for US customers with credit card billing can now view all classic infrastructure and platform services on one invoice. In the {{site.data.keyword.cloud_notm}} console, go to **Manage** > **Billing and usage**, and select **Invoices**. 

The new invoice hierarchy highlights the most important details. By showcasing when the usage is measured, you can view each invoice’s billing period in a clarified and comprehensive manner. The adjustments section on your invoice provides details about credits and adjustments from previous billing periods that might be included on an invoice from a different month. 

The charges on your invoice are consistent with the usage dashboard. On the Invoices page in the console, click **View usage** to be directed to your usage dashboard. From there, you can select a timeframe and view billing and usage information that aligns directly with the details in your invoice. 

### Checking your invoice status 
{: #status-invoices}

You can check the status of your invoice on the [Invoices page](/billing/invoices): 

* **Invoiced**: You received the latest invoice from {{site.data.keyword.cloud_notm}}. 
* **Paid**: Your payment for the charges on your latest invoice was received.
* **Unpaid**: The charges on your latest invoice have not been paid.
* **Pending**: Your payment for your latest charges has not been applied due to a payment processing error. In this case, you can contact {{site.data.keyword.cloud_notm}} Support for more details about the error. 

Turning a resource "off" doesn't cancel the resource in your account. You will receive invoices for resources in your account until you cancel them. For more information, see [Cancelling your billing items](/docs/billing-usage?topic=billing-usage-cancel-billing-items).
