# Applying promo codes
{: #applying-promo-codes}

Promotions are limited-time credits toward your {{site.data.keyword.Bluemix}} account and services that you can get by applying promo codes. Each promo code can be used one time and is valid only for a certain amount of time. Promo codes are provided on a limited basis by {{site.data.keyword.Bluemix_notm}} sales to customers with billable accounts.
{: shortdesc}

Promo codes are typically based on short phrases, like `PROMO200`. If you have an alphanumeric code, such as `a1b2c3def456`, it's a different type of code that is referred to as a feature code. You can apply these codes on the **Manage > Account > Account settings** page or when you register for a new account. For more information, see [Applying feature codes](/docs/account?topic=account-codes).
{: tip}

Promotions are one type of credit for your account. For example, if you have a Pay-As-You-Go or Subscription account, you can use promo codes for limited-time credits toward your account and {{site.data.keyword.Bluemix_notm}} products. Promo codes are different from feature codes that provide access to Trial accounts, or subscriptions that add credits as discounts to your account.

Promo codes cannot be used for third-party services unless otherwise stated in the definition of the promo code. 
{: note}

## Types of available promotion credits
{: #available-promo-credit}

Both one-time credit promotions and recurring dollar credit promotions are available for all {{site.data.keyword.Bluemix_notm}} products.

1. One-time credit promotion
    * Credit promotions can be used only one time, for a set time period, and you can't remove them after you apply them. Credit promotions use the following format: $X off for Y days.

2. Recurring dollar credit promotion
    * Recurring dollar credits are offered for a set time period. For example, you can have a promotion of $100 USD value that is recurring every 30 days for 6 months. Recurring dollar credit promotions use the following format: $X every Y months, repeats Z times.
    * Promo credit expires at the end of the committed term. Any credit that isn't used doesn't roll over to the next term.

        With a recurring credit, if the amount of credit that is allocated to a client is not used within the allocated time, the credit expires.

## Applying promo codes to your account
